Yet Another Backbone Binding Extension (Yabbe)
====

So why add to the already growing number of libraries to do data binding?  None of the existing libraries seemed to fit `Backbone` very well or they were missing some power.

This library is intended to provide a style of data binding that will immediately be familiar to users of `Backbone`.  Yabbe will also not stand in your way if you don't want to use data binding for certain elements.

Yabbe is still in early development and the API is subject to change.
