Yet Another Backbone Binding Extension (Yabbe)
====

So why add to the already growing number of libraries to do data binding?  

* `Yabbe` fits backbone nicely
* `Yabbe` forgoes much of the magic of other libraries for just a little more typing
* `Yabbe` fully supports computed properties

This library is intended to provide a style of data binding that will be immediately familiar to users of `Backbone`.  `Yabbe` will also not stand in your way if you don't want to use data binding for certain elements.

###Note###
Yabbe is still in early development and the API is subject to change.  Binding is currently uni-directional (from models to views).  Bi-directional binding will be added in a future version.

Test cases are still being written to flex and verify all of the different pieces of the code.

###TODO###
* Bi-directional binding
* Binding for collections
* Clean up overlaoded method handling code
